## Exam Information

- **Duration**: 2 hours
- **Allowed materials**: None (closed book)
- **Total points**: 100

## Topics Covered

- Software fault-error-failure chain
- Fault classification and taxonomy
- Testing strategies: structural and functional
- Code coverage criteria (statement, branch, MC/DC)
- Mutation testing fundamentals
- Static analysis concepts

## Question Summary

1. **(20 pts)** Define and distinguish between faults, errors, and failures with concrete examples. Explain why not every fault leads to a failure.

2. **(20 pts)** Given a program with conditional logic, derive test cases that achieve:
   a) 100% statement coverage
   b) 100% branch coverage
   c) Explain why branch coverage does not guarantee all faults are found.

3. **(25 pts)** Given a function and a set of mutants, determine which test cases kill each mutant. Calculate the mutation score and identify any equivalent mutants.

4. **(15 pts)** Compare static analysis and dynamic testing. List two strengths and two limitations of each approach.

5. **(20 pts)** A system has a measured failure rate of 0.002 failures/hour. Calculate:
   a) Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
   b) Reliability over a 100-hour mission
   c) The availability if Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) is 5 hours
