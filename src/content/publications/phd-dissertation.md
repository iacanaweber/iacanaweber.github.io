## Abstract

This dissertation investigates the vulnerability of RISC-V processors to soft errors caused by radiation and proposes novel mitigation techniques combining hardware redundancy with software-based detection mechanisms. The proposed approaches were validated through extensive fault injection campaigns and demonstrated significant improvements in system reliability with minimal performance overhead.
