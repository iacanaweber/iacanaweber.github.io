        <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
        <p>
          All students are expected to follow the university's academic integrity policies.
          The following guidelines apply to all courses:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Homework assignments must be completed individually unless explicitly stated otherwise.</li>
          <li>You may discuss general concepts with classmates, but all submitted work must be your own.</li>
          <li>Copying code, solutions, or text from any source (including AI tools) without attribution is considered plagiarism.</li>
          <li>If in doubt about whether something constitutes a violation, ask the instructor before submitting.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Use of AI Tools</h2>
        <p>
          The use of AI assistants (such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.) may be permitted for certain
          assignments, depending on the course and the specific task. Each assignment will clearly state
          whether AI tools are allowed and under what conditions. When AI use is permitted:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You must disclose which tools you used and how.</li>
          <li>You must understand and be able to explain every part of your submission.</li>
          <li>The final work must reflect your own understanding.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Late Submissions</h2>
        <p>
          Unless otherwise stated in the assignment, late submissions will incur a penalty.
          Contact the instructor in advance if you have extenuating circumstances.
